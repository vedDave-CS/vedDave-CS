# 👋 Hi, I'm Ved Dave!

🎓 Rising Sophomore at **Penn State University – University Park**  
🔐 Studying **Cybersecurity**, minoring in **Information Sciences and Technology**  
🧠 Interests: Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence  

Technology excites me because it’s always evolving—and with the rise of AI and machine learning, there are endless ways to branch out within cybersecurity and beyond. I’m currently a **Break Through Tech Fellow**, and this May I’m proud to participate in their **Sprinternship** program.

I'm actively looking for roles and internships in **Cybersecurity**, where I can keep learning, contribute to real-world projects, and build safer systems.
